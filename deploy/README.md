# Deploying Endod Health

One Docker Compose project (`endod`) on the server: Postgres, the API
(`backend-v2`), the patient web app (`frontend`) and a Cloudflare Tunnel.
Nothing is published on the host, so it runs next to other projects
(e.g. the server's existing nginx on ports 80/443) without touching them.

```
browser ──HTTPS──> Cloudflare ──tunnel──> cloudflared ──> frontend:3000 ──> backend:8000 ──> postgres
```

## One-time setup

1. **DNS**: the domain's nameservers must be Cloudflare's (registrar dashboard).
2. **Tunnel** (Cloudflare Zero Trust > Networks > Tunnels, or the API):
   create a tunnel, add a public hostname `endod-health.com` (and
   `www.endod-health.com` if wanted) with service `http://frontend:3000`,
   and copy its token.
3. **Server**: Docker with the Compose plugin. Put the repository in
   `/opt/endod` and create `deploy/.env` from `deploy/.env.example`
   (secrets: `openssl rand -base64 48`).

## Deploy / update

```sh
cd /opt/endod/deploy
docker compose --env-file .env up -d --build
docker compose ps            # all healthy
docker compose logs -f backend
```

The API creates and migrates its tables on start.

## Staging vs production

All messages go by SMS through SMS Ethiopia: verification codes and
appointment reminders (`REMINDER_CHANNELS=sms`; there is no email). The
patient app has no AI agent, so no model key is configured
(`AI_PROVIDER_MODE=offline`).

`ENVIRONMENT=staging` works before the SMS Ethiopia key exists: codes are
written to the API log (`docker compose logs backend | grep -i code`).
Switch to `ENVIRONMENT=production` once `SMSETHIOPIA_API_KEY` is set
(production refuses to fake a send), and turn on
`NOTIFICATION_WORKER_ENABLED=true` at the same time so reminders go out.

## Backups

```sh
docker compose exec -T postgres pg_dump -U endod endod | gzip > endod-$(date +%F).sql.gz
```

## Rollback

Check out the previous commit in `/opt/endod` and run the deploy command again.
Database changes are additive, so an older API runs on a newer schema.
